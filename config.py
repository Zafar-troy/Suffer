# entirely rather than posted late — a "Kickoff" or "Goal" post showing
# up minutes after it actually happened, possibly AFTER a later event
# from the same match already posted, looks broken to followers even
# though nothing was technically lost. Dropping stale events immediately
# also frees up rate-limit/queue capacity for genuinely live events
# instead of burning it retrying news that's no longer useful.
# NOTE: if MAX_EVENT_AGE_MINUTES is set in your .env (or Railway/host

# data/teams_master.json (~200+ teams) — too heavy to run every
# POLL_INTERVAL tick, so it runs on its own slower interval instead.
# Once a watched team's match goes live, the normal live pipeline
# (scraper.py / sofascore.py) picks up goals/cards/half-time/full-time
# on its own — this only handles the pre-match "fixture today" alert.

# ── Per-league on/off switches (team_fixtures.py) ────────────────────
# Every fixture alert produced from data/teams_master.json is tagged
# with the league it was found under (see team_fixtures.load_master_list
# -> each team's "league" field, which is literally the top-level key in
# teams_master.json — "Premier League", "La Liga", etc). This lets you
# cut the daily fixture-alert volume down to just the leagues you care
# about on a busy day (e.g. a pre-season friendly pile-up), without
# touching the master team list itself.
#
# Turn a league OFF here and:
#   - its watched teams' fixtures won't get a pre-match "today" alert
#   - BUT if one of those teams' matches kicks off anyway, it still
#     flows through the normal live pipeline (scraper.py/sofascore.py)
#     and posts goals/cards/half-time/full-time as usual — this toggle
#     ONLY silences the pre-match fixture-list alert, nothing live.
# If a fixture has one watched team in an ON league and the other in an
# OFF league (e.g. an interleague friendly), it's posted — ON wins over
# OFF whenever either side qualifies. A league name not listed below
# defaults to ON (fails open, so nothing silently vanishes just because
# you forgot to add a new league key here).
#
# Each can also be flipped via env var (e.g. LEAGUE_LA_LIGA=false in
# .env/Railway) without editing this file — the hardcoded value below
# is just the fallback when no env var is set.
#
# leagues.json (repo root, optional) takes priority over BOTH of the
# above for any league key it lists — this is the file meant to be
# hand-edited directly on GitHub (web editor or the mobile app) and
# pushed. Railway's GitHub auto-deploy then picks up the new choices
# on its own, no need to touch Railway's env var UI at all. A league
# left out of leagues.json still falls back to its env var / default,
# so a partial file (or no file) is always safe.
