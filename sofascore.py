sofascore.py — Match Corna Live: SofaScore data layer
======================================================
Sole source, called from scraper.get_todays_matches(). ESPN was
removed as a data source (its per-league scoreboard polling — dozens
of sequential HTTP calls every tick — was the main cause of events
posting more than 3 minutes late).

WHY SOFASCORE:
  A single "live events" feed call (no key, no auth) covers everything
  currently live, rather than one HTTP round-trip per league slug.
  This module normalises that feed into the same match dict shape the
  old ESPN normaliser used to produce, so poster.py, graphics.py, and
  bot.py need no changes at all.

COVERAGE NOTE:
  The whitelist below (PRIORITY_TOURNAMENTS / SECONDARY_TOURNAMENTS /
  ALWAYS_INCLUDE_COUNTRIES) is deliberately curated, not exhaustive.
  A few leagues ESPN used to cover — MLS, Liga MX, Brasileirao, FA Cup,
  club friendlies — aren't on it yet. Add them to PRIORITY_TOURNAMENTS
  or SECONDARY_TOURNAMENTS below if you want them back.

MATCH INCLUSION (deliberately curated, NOT everything live):
  ✅ Any tournament in KNOWN_TOURNAMENTS (below)
  ✅ Any tournament whose category country is in ALWAYS_INCLUDE_COUNTRIES
     (catches every Malawian competition automatically, current or future)
  ✅ Any senior men's international (country vs country), reusing the
     same is_national_team() logic scraper.py already uses for ESPN
  ❌ Everything else — amateur/reserve/youth friendlies, women's and
     age-group football (unless a competition is explicitly whitelisted),
     and any tournament not on the list. This is what keeps the page
     from drowning in obscure lower-league and reserve-team friendlies.

GOALS / RED CARDS:
  Fetched via a second call to /event/{id}/incidents — only for matches
  that already passed the whitelist filter above, to keep API calls
  reasonable. SofaScore's incident shape is not officially documented,
  so this is parsed defensively: if a field is missing or shaped
  unexpectedly, the goal/card is skipped rather than guessed at.
  ⚠️ NEEDS LIVE VERIFICATION against a real match before you trust the
  scorer/assist/card output blindly — this cannot be fully tested
  offline since it depends on SofaScore's real in-play incident feed.
