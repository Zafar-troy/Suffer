team_fixtures.py — Match Corna Live: master-team-list fixture alerts
=====================================================================
A THIRD data path, separate from scraper.py's get_todays_matches() and the tournament
whitelist in sofascore.py (get_live_matches()). Those two answer "what's
live right now in a competition we recognise?". This module answers a
different question: "what are OUR watched teams playing today?" — driven
by an explicit master list of SofaScore team IDs (data/teams_master.json)
rather than by tournament name.

Why not just reuse sofascore._normalize_sofascore()?
  That function's tier check (_tournament_tier) silently drops anything
  not in PRIORITY_TOURNAMENTS / SECONDARY_TOURNAMENTS / an always-include
  country. Several leagues in the master list — MLS, Saudi Pro League,
  Brazil Série A, South African Premiership — aren't on either list, so
  every fixture for those teams would vanish before you ever saw it.
  Inclusion here is decided by TEAM, not by tournament name (see step 5
  below), so this module has its own lightweight normaliser instead.

PIPELINE (as specified):
  1. Master Team List   — load every monitored team ID (data/teams_master.json)
  2. Fetch Fixtures     — query SofaScore's "next events" endpoint per team
  3. Extract Details    — event id, kickoff ts, team ids, tournament, status
  4. Filter by Date     — keep only fixtures whose kickoff is today (Malawi local day)
  5. Check Team Inclusion — home or away team id must be in the master list
  5b. Check League Toggle — at least one watched side's league must be ON
       in config.WATCHED_LEAGUES (data/teams_master.json's top-level key
       is the league name each team is tagged with). Lets you mute a
       specific league's pre-match alerts on a busy day without editing
       the master list itself.
  6. Deduplicate        — skip event ids already alerted (state file)
  7. Publish            — format + output the alert

Steps 5 and 6 look redundant with step 2 (we only ever fetched fixtures
FOR master-list teams) but they matter in practice: (a) SofaScore's
next-events endpoint occasionally returns a neighbouring team's fixture
row it shouldn't, so step 5 is a cheap safety net rather than a trust
exercise; (b) the same fixture is fetched twice whenever BOTH sides are
in the master list (e.g. Arsenal vs Chelsea), so step 6's dedupe-by-
event-id is what collapses that into a single alert.

LIVE FOLLOW-UP (goals / half-time / red cards / full-time / extra time /
penalties): this module only produces the pre-match alert. The event
dict it emits is deliberately shaped exactly like sofascore.py's own
normalised match dict (same "id": "sofascore_<event id>" convention), so
once the match kicks off it shows up naturally in sofascore.get_live_matches()
and bot.process_match() takes over posting those events through the
existing pipeline — nothing further to wire up here.
